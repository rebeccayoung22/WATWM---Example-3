In 2003, Women at the Well Ministries was birthed from a ten-year homeless outreach to a 501c3 non-profit organization. Our Mission is to be actively involved in helping to produce positive life-change and introduce hope to the underprivileged. Dedication combined with commitment has been the passion of our mission, which is anchored on a platform of perserverance and integrity.<br>

</br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Throughout our many years of operation, we have had the privilege to create various education and training programs that have proven to produce positive life-change. A such notable program is the Life Purpose Enrichment Program, which is a six-week program that was run 4 times a year at the Chapman Center in Downtown Miami.  Through small group discussions, local key community speakers, and group projects this program gave people the tools to identify life-destructive patterns, evaluate healthy methods of change and implement a way to reverse the old pattern of behavior.  This allowed the participants to take personal resonsibility in embracing a healthy approach to transformed life.  The Kidz Zone program, provides one and half hours of innovation and creativity to underprivileged children through dance expression. In 2013 we have created a healthy living initiative set of programs.  These programs again fall into education and training youth, individuals and families how to grow sustainable vegetable gardens, nutrition, and exercise to combat the obesity epidemic in our country. In our most recent initiative we have collaborated with the Florida Farm Bureau, AG in the Classroom, and school teachers to build school gardens, and encourage our youth to make healthier eating choices.</p>
